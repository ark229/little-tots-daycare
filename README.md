# Little Tots Daycare Center</h1>
<br>

## Module 8 Web Project</h2>

This website serves as the business page for the Little Tots Daycare center.
The purpose of the business site is to act as a place where vistors, parents, and 
potential students can learn more about the daycare. It also has a place where 
individuals can send emails to the daycare via the <b>"contact button"</b> function.
 
The final website can be viewed here: https://ark229.github.io/little-tots-daycare/

### ðŸ’¼ The Website Wireframe 
The below wireframes shows the layout of each active page and pop up modal. Even though the daycare 
website contains several links and buttons, for this project, there are only three active pages
(home, about, and programs) and one contact form modal. Each page follows a similar layout and function which
is mainly to display information about the daycare and its programs.

### ðŸ’¼ Website Functionality
As stated previously, this website has three active pages to include the home, about, and programs page.
Every link on the navigation bar (that resides at the top of the page) is active with the exception of the 
"Login" link. The thought is to have the "Login" link to redirect parents to a student account portal like 
Parentvue.

One the <b>home page</b> there is "Play" button that is active, and when the user clicks it, it will send the user
to a "preschool" online YouTube page. The rest of the hompage is for informational purposes.

The <b>footer</b> contains several links and information. Only one link works in the footer and that's the one 
labeled "Programs". That link act as another option and will take the user to the "Programs Page".

On the <b>About page</b> there is an embedded video that the user can play. This is a quick introduction video
for the daycare where users can get a quick overview of what the daycare has to offer and their values and beliefs.
The rest of the page contains text that digs deeper into what the daycare is about for the user and potential customer
to go over.

The <b>Programs Page</b> is pretty much all text. I tried to use as much color as possible to help grab the users attention,
and to create a child-like experience to go with the daycare theme. 

The <b>Contact Form Modal</b> is the main function of this website. Users need a way to contact the daycare. So instead of 
creating a separate page for the contact form, I decided to create a pop up modal that contained the contact form. When the user clicks
on the "Contact" button located on the navigation bar, the contact form will "pop up" on the screen. The user can click anywhere on 
the screen (or window) outside the form to make it disappear, or they can simply click the "X" located on the far right of the 
screen.

The user can interacts with the contact modal by typing their name, email, and message and submitting it over a cloud server. 
The mail server is hosted by formssubmit.co. The user must enter their name and email address before submitting. If the user tries
to submit the form without doing so, the form will trigger an error alert, and the name and email sections will turn red,
prompting the user to enter their information first. Once the user clicks "Submit", an alert will pop up, informing the user that their
form was submitted, and they will recieve a reply within 48 hours. Since I decided to use a third party server to send and recieve
emails -- the user will be redirected to a formsubmit.co page that simply confirms that the email was sent.
