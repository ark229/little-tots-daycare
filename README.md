  This website serves as the business page for the Little Tots Daycare center.
  The purpose of the business site is to act as a place where vistors, parents, and 
  potential students can learn more about the daycare. It also has a place where 
  individuals can send emails to the daycare via the <b>"contact button"</b> function.
